**Predictive algorithms:** Based on weather data, flight duration, and container properties, predict internal temperature and adjust passive elements (e.g., PCM placement) or activate cooling units.

**Adaptive control algorithms:** Monitor internal temperature in real-time and adjust cooling/heating intensity of Peltier devices for precise temperature regulation.
